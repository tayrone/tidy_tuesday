```{r}

  select(age, height, weight, sport) %>%

```



```{r}

set.seed(321)

initial_split <- initial_split(summer_olympics, prop = 0.66)


train <- training(initial_split)

test <- testing(initial_split)

```

```{r}

glm_spec <- logistic_reg() %>% set_engine("glm")

glm_fit <- glm_spec %>% 
  fit(sport ~ age + height + weight, data = train)

tidy(glm_fit)

```


```{r}

prediction <- predict(glm_fit, new_data = test)

prediction <- bind_cols(test, prediction)

prediction %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  metrics(truth = sport, estimate = .pred_class)

prediction %>% 
  ggplot(aes(.pred_class, `sport`)) +
  geom_point()

```
